"""dgemma/loop.py — the denoising-loop spine (ADR-CDG-004 drive seam).

Drives a preloaded `DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion` (from `dgemma/model.py`)
through `diffusers.DiffusionGemmaPipeline` + `EntropyBoundScheduler`, per
ADR-CDG-004. Per-step frames are the loop's native contract from day one
(plan.md, `dgemma/loop.py` per-module notes): P1 keeps only the last frame
(`keep_frames="last"`), but the collection seam iterates every step
regardless, so P2 (knobs) and P3 (instrumentation) grow the same generator
without a reshape.

**Diffusers version guard + structural probe (issue #35 R3, ARCHITECTURE.md
"No diffusers version guard" row).** Enforced by `dgemma/compat.py`'s
`assert_diffusers_compatible()`, called below before this module's own
`from diffusers import ...` line — this module is still diffusers' real
import site (`model.py`'s transformers guard has its own module; this is the
twin, here rather than there because `import diffusers` happens here, not in
`model.py` — verified: `dgemma/__init__.py` imports `.loop` before `.model`,
so in practice diffusers lands in `sys.modules` before transformers does on a
fresh `import dgemma`). See `compat.py`'s module docstring for the guard's
full rationale, including the anneal-formula-body residual neither check can
see (PR #48 gate finding F-1), enforced instead by
`tests/test_diffusers_version_guard.py:TestAnnealFormulaPin` against
`anneal_temperature` (`dgemma/capture.py`).

class DGemmaPipeline(DiffusionGemmaPipeline):
    """`DiffusionGemmaPipeline` subclass widening the per-step callback allowlist.

    The ONLY change from the base pipeline: `_callback_tensor_inputs` gains
    `"scheduler_output"`. The base class allowlist is `["canvas", "logits"]`
    (`pipeline_diffusion_gemma.py:76`); `check_inputs` validates
    `callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs` against `self._callback_tensor_inputs`

    `callback_kwargs[k] = locals()[k]` (`:404-405`) — not a hardcoded
    two-key dispatch. Widening the allowlist here is therefore enough to hand
    the callback the full scheduler `.step()` output object (`accepted_index`,
    `sampled_probs`, `pred_logits`, ...) with no method override needed
    (ADR-CDG-004, resolved open question (a)).

    Caveat carried from that resolution: `"accepted_index"` alone is NOT a

    """Drive one prompt through the block-diffusion denoising loop.

    Constructs `EntropyBoundScheduler` directly with the entropy/temperature
    config (`entropy_bound`, `t_min`, `t_max`, `num_inference_steps`) — these
    live on the scheduler config, NOT on the pipeline's `__call__` (ADR-CDG-004:
    the pipeline only forwards `generator`/`mask_token_id`/`temperature` to
    `scheduler.step()`, filtered by that scheduler's own signature, and
    `EntropyBoundScheduler.step()` doesn't accept `mask_token_id` or
    `temperature` at all — it anneals its own). Wraps the loaded model in
    `DGemmaPipeline` (direct-constructor idiom, not `.from_pretrained`, since
    the model is already loaded).

    `confidence` promotes the pipeline's `confidence_threshold` to a real
    parameter (P2). `stability_threshold`/`eos_early_stop` stay at the
    pipeline's own defaults (1 / True — already the grounded defaults,
    CLAUDE.md); P2 only promoted the knobs plan.md names for Phase 2.

    `thinking` (P2, model-card documented mechanism): when `True`, the
    `<|think|>` control token is injected at the start of the (otherwise
    empty) system turn by passing an explicit `messages=[{"role": "system",
    "content": THINK_TOKEN}, {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]`. This is
    the ONLY viable path here: the pipeline's `_prepare_inputs` never
    forwards `enable_thinking` (or any extra kwargs) to
    `apply_chat_template`, so the template's native toggle is unreachable
    through `pipeline.__call__`. **Honest delta, pinned by
    `tests/test_chat_template_thinking.py` against the real tokenizer
    (2026-07-05):** the injected path is NOT token-identical to the native
    `enable_thinking=True` render — the template emits system content
    through `| trim`, which eats the newline the native path places after
    `<|think|>`, so the injected render is exactly one token short (id 107,
    `"\\n"`, between `<|think|>` and `<turn|>`). Token parity is
    structurally unreachable via message content (any trailing whitespace is
    trimmed). Behavioral impact of the missing newline is unverified pending
    an E2E thinking-mode run; the `<|think|>` token itself (id 98) lands in
    the documented position either way. When `False` (default), `prompt` is
    passed bare — unchanged from P1, no system turn is added.

    Regardless of `thinking`, the thought channel the model emits at turn
    start (issue #8 — empty when off, per the model card's "an empty
    thinking channel might still be emitted"; possibly non-empty when on) is
    excised from the canvas ids via `excise_thought_channel` before `text`
    is derived, so it never leaks onto the `STRING` payload in either mode.

    `keep_frames` defaults to `"all"` (P3): per-step state here is small
    (ADR-CDG-005's own domain framing — a `gen_length`-length int64 canvas
    plus a per-example float per step), so retaining every step for the
    returned `CanvasTrace` isn't worth gating behind a toggle. `on_frame`,
    when given, is invoked once per captured step regardless of
    `keep_frames` — the seam that lets `nodes/sampler.py` push a live view
    without this module ever importing ComfyUI (ADR-CDG-003): the callback
    body that touches `PromptServer` lives in the node layer, not here.
    `on_frame` exceptions propagate (engine contract — see
    `_FrameCollector`'s docstring): a callback that must never kill the run
    guards itself, as the node layer's display-only closure does.

    `should_cancel` (issue #38, folded into R1's composer spec per the #35
    handoff): a zero-argument, surface-neutral predicate checked once per
    step by `dgemma.composite.StepEndComposite`, AFTER that step's capture
    (ADR-CDG-010 cancellation amendment 2026-07-13, PR #45) — surface-
    agnostic by construction (ARCHITECTURE.md rule 1): a ComfyUI surface
    wires this to `comfy.model_management`'s interrupt check, an MCP surface
    wires it to its own abort signal, and this module never imports either.
    When the predicate reports `True`, the composite raises
    `DiffusionCancelled`, caught here to return the PARTIAL
    `(text, CanvasState, CanvasTrace)` built from every frame captured so
    far — INCLUDING the cancelled step's own committed frame, the run's
    exact truncation point (the scheduler has already committed that step
    by `callback_on_step_end` time; see `dgemma/composite.py`'s module
    docstring) — evidence is returned, not raised away (#38's "a cancelled
    experiment run is still data" clause). `None` (default) means no
    cancellation wiring; the run always completes or raises a real error,
    exactly today's behavior.

    The single `callback_on_step_end` slot passed to the pipeline is a
    `dgemma.composite.StepEndComposite` (ADR-CDG-010 Decision 3 + its
    cancellation amendment), not the collector directly — the composite's
    fixed order is `capture -> cancellation check -> beta-rebuild -> pin ->
    walker`. `capture` and the cancellation seam are always wired; `pin` is
    wired (issue #64 Phase 3) with a fresh `PinParticipant` whenever
    `constraints=` carries at least one pin, `()` otherwise; `walker` is
    wired (issue #64 Phase 4) with a fresh `WalkerParticipant` whenever
    `control_signals=` carries at least one binding, `None` otherwise — so a
    run with no constraints/control_signals still builds an empty `pin=`
    tuple and a `None` `walker=`, and the composite's behavior is identical
    to invoking the collector alone, exactly as before either phase. The
    beta-rebuild participant (ADR-CDG-010) remains `NOT-YET-IMPLEMENTED` —
    Phase 5 lands that body; this phase only fills the `walker` slot the
    scaffold already exposed.

    `logit_hook` (#35 R5, F4; ADR-CDG-010 Decision 5): an optional forward
    hook installed on `dgemma_model.model` for exactly the duration of the
    one pipeline call below, via `dgemma.hooks.install_logit_shaping_hook` —
    the ONLY sanctioned installation path for a hook on this door (the only
    logit-shaping door per issue #28: a callback-returned `{"logits": ...}`
    is silently discarded by the installed pipeline). `None` when
    `constraints=` is also `None` installs nothing and leaves zero hooks
    registered, trivially satisfying `STATELESS-CORE`'s "no hook survives a
    `run_diffusion` call" (rule 6): the context manager's `try/finally`
    guarantees teardown on the pipeline call's clean return, on
    `DiffusionCancelled` (caught below), and on any other exception raised
    mid-run — the hook is torn down before this function's own exception
    handling (or return) is reached in every case. Passing BOTH
    `constraints=` and `logit_hook=` is rejected at ingress (H1, below) —
    two logit-mask sources on one door (ADR-CDG-010 D5).

    `constraints=`/`control_signals=`/`capture=` (ADR-CDG-010/011/014, issue
    #64/#61): declarative payloads, validated at ingress (`dgemma.ingress.
    validate_ingress`). `capture=`'s Tier 1 knob (`top_k`, ADR-CDG-014
    Decision 3, issue #61 P-B) is LIVE: when `capture.top_k > 0`, the
    `_FrameCollector` derives `DiffusionFrame.top_k_ids`/`top_k_weights` from
    the same pre-pin `logits` Tier 0's `entropy` reads — see `_FrameCollector.
    on_step_end`'s docstring. `capture=None`/`capture.top_k` absent/`0`
    (default) leaves both fields `None`, byte-identical to every run before
    that phase. `capture=`'s Tier 2 knobs (`capture_full_distribution`/
    `max_full_distribution_steps`, ADR-CDG-014 Decision 3/5, issue #61 P-C)
    are also LIVE: when `capture.capture_full_distribution=True`, the
    `_FrameCollector` derives `DiffusionFrame.distribution` (the full
    per-position `softmax(logits)`) from the same pre-pin `logits`, retained
    only for the first `capture.max_full_distribution_steps` captured steps
    — ingress rejects `capture_full_distribution=True` with no budget, so
    this call site never sees an unbounded request. `capture=None`/
    `capture.capture_full_distribution` absent/`False` (default) leaves
    `distribution` `None` on every frame, byte-identical to every run before
    P-C. `capture.keep_frames` remains validated-then-ignored (issue
    #64 P1, unchanged — see `dgemma/payloads.py:CaptureSpec`).
    `constraints=` is LIVE end-to-end (issue #64 Phase
    3, ADR-CDG-010's two-mechanism givens): when it carries at least one pin,
    `run_diffusion` (a) builds `dgemma.constraints_hook.build_logit_mask_hook`
    from the pins and installs it via the existing `logit_hook=`/
    `install_logit_shaping_hook` path — masking each pinned position's
    logits to its `token_id` so that cell reads ~zero entropy and commits
    first (Decision 1(a)); and (b) constructs a
    `dgemma.participants.PinParticipant` and wires it into the composite's
    `pin=` slot (Decision 3's LAST writer), re-asserting every pin's
    `token_id` at its `position` on every step regardless of what the
    scheduler accepted (Decision 1(b)) — the mechanism that guarantees *what
    conditions* the next forward pass, since a real scheduler step renoises
    every rejected position over the full vocabulary (no absorbing mask,
    ADR-CDG-001) and a given re-checked only at ingress would drift the
    first time its cell isn't accepted. `Constraints(pins=())`/`None`
    installs neither the hook nor the participant (empty == no-op,
    `dgemma/payloads.py`) — byte-identical to today's no-`constraints=`
    behavior. `control_signals=` is now LIVE (issue #64 Phase 4, ADR-CDG-011):
    when it carries at least one binding, `run_diffusion` constructs a
    `dgemma.participants.WalkerParticipant` bound to THIS call's `scheduler`
    and wires it into the composite's `walker=` slot (LAST, after every
    canvas-writer) — at the callback for `step_idx = k` the walker maps
    `signal[k + 1]` into the binding's declared `[low, high]` range and
    writes it via `scheduler.register_to_config(...)`, preparing step
    `k + 1`'s config (clause 6); `signal[0]` is never applied (the gate
    ruling on issue #64, O1) and the final step is a no-op (no step `k + 1`
    left to prepare) — see `dgemma.participants.WalkerParticipant`'s
    docstring for the full mechanism. `ControlSignals(bindings=())`/`None`
    builds no walker (empty == no-op) — byte-identical to today's
    no-`control_signals=` behavior. An invalid payload of any of the three
    still raises at ingress regardless of phase; `constraints=` +
    `logit_hook=` together still raise at ingress (H1) even now that
    `constraints=` builds its own hook internally — the two-source-on-one-door
    reject is unconditional.

    Returns `(text, CanvasState, CanvasTrace)` — never a bare string
    (ADR-CDG-001 Addendum). `CanvasTrace` carries `collector.frames` plus
    the scheduler's class name and the entropy/temperature config passed to
    it, per ADR-CDG-001's addendum on scheduler-relative commit semantics
    (a trace without the scheduler identity that minted its commit readings
    is a lying payload). It also carries `raw_canvas_ids` (ADR-CDG-014
    Decision 6, issue #11): the pre-excision final canvas ids, captured in
    `_build_result` before `excise_thought_channel` runs — the raw view
    `CanvasState.canvas_ids` (post-excision) does not carry. Each captured
    `DiffusionFrame` also carries `entropy` (ADR-CDG-014 Decision 3/4, issue
    #14): per-position predictive entropy derived from that step's pre-pin
    `logits`, always populated (Tier 0's always-on default);
    `top_k_ids`/`top_k_weights` (ADR-CDG-014 Decision 3, issue #61 P-B):
    per-position top-k candidate ids and their top-k-renormalized weights
    from the same pre-pin `logits`, populated only when `capture.top_k > 0`
    (`None`/`None` otherwise — Tier 1's on-request default);
    `distribution` (ADR-CDG-014 Decision 3/5, issue #61 P-C): the full
    per-position distribution (`softmax(logits)`) from the same pre-pin
    `logits`, populated only when `capture.capture_full_distribution=True`
    AND the step is still within `capture.max_full_distribution_steps`'s
    retention budget — `None` otherwise (Tier 2's explicit-opt-in-with-budget
    default; `None` also once the budget is exhausted mid-run, Decision 5);
    `pinned_mask`
    (ADR-CDG-010 D4, issue #64 Phase 2/3): `True` at every supplied
    `Constraints` pin position — now the positions `PinParticipant` actually
    (re-)writes every step (Phase 3), consistent with the Phase 2
    static-from-`Constraints.pins` derivation because a hard pin's position
    set never changes step to step (see `DiffusionFrame.pinned_mask`'s
    docstring for the scope guard) — `None` when no constraints were given;
    and
    `effective_entropy_bound`/`effective_t_min`/`effective_t_max`
    (ADR-CDG-011 clause 7, issue #64 Phase 2): the `entropy_bound`/`t_min`/
    `t_max` values `scheduler.config` actually held at that callback — the
    honest-telemetry fields the control-signal walker (issue #64 Phase 4)
    writes through via `register_to_config`, visible in the NEXT captured
    frame after the walker's write (clause 6: walker prepares the next step,
    capture records the finished step).

    `kv_cache=` (ADR-CDG-012 IN-2, issue #62 Phase 2 — types + ingress door;
    Phase 4 decoder-drive body NOT YET BUILT, issue #207 makes that gap fail
    loud rather than silently no-op): an optional injected `KVCache` payload
    (§62's `dgemma/types.py` dataclass). `None` (default) is today's EXACT
    behavior, byte-for-byte unchanged — the run mints its own cache
    internally via the pipeline's own first encode, and rule-6
    `STATELESS-CORE` is trivially satisfied (no injected state crosses).
    When non-`None`, `dgemma.kv_cache.validate_kv_cache_ingress(kv_cache,
    dgemma_model)` fires BEFORE the scheduler/pipeline are constructed
    (fail-on-mismatch, rule 5 `EMIT-CANONICAL / PARSE-AT-THE-DOOR` — a bad
    cache is rejected before any resource tied to this call is built), and
    on pass this function **still raises** — `NotImplementedError` naming
    issue #62 Phase 4 — because a well-formed injected cache is not the same
    thing as a path that can honor it: the decoder-drive body that would
    actually consume the cache's tensors does not exist yet (Open Question
    #1, gated on the ADR's real-weights de-risk smoke test), and letting a
    validated-but-ignored cache silently fall through to an uninjected run
    would itself be the `EMIT-CANONICAL / PARSE-AT-THE-DOOR` violation this
    ADR's own ingress discipline forbids (issue #207 operator ruling,
    2026-08-01). The input `kv_cache` payload is never mutated by this
    function regardless (§3 advance-returns-new-payload discipline — this
    phase only reads it before raising).

    Raises `ValueError` if `t_min >= t_max` (parse-at-the-door validation —
    an inverted or degenerate anneal range would silently hand
    `EntropyBoundScheduler` a nonsensical temperature trajectory), if
    ingress validation of `constraints`/`control_signals`/`capture`/the
    `constraints`+`logit_hook` combination fails (see
    `dgemma.ingress.validate_ingress`'s error register), or if `kv_cache` is
    given and fails `validate_kv_cache_ingress`'s V1-V6 checks (see
