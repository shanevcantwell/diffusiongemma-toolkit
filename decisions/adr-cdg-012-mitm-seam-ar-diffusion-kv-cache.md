# ADR-CDG-012 — MITM the AR/diffusion seam: a `KV_CACHE` socket + `DGemmaEncode`/`DGemmaDenoise` node pair

**Status**: proposed
**Date**: 2026-07-13
**Related**: ADR-CDG-001 (native socket types — this ADR's fingerprint/ingress
rule is a direct instance of "payloads mean what they say"), ADR-CDG-005
(`CANVAS_STATE` resumable save-state — KV's exclusion there was economy, not
impossibility; this ADR does not reopen it), ADR-CDG-006 (step-window resume —
this ADR extends its ownership model one axis, the cache), ADR-CDG-008
(MCP-center topology — this decision lands core-side of the surface seam, so
every surface inherits it), ADR-CDG-010 / ADR-CDG-011 (composite ordering and
declarative-ingress discipline — the node pair inherits both), Issue #47
(primary source — grounding report, payload-richness refinement, serialization
correction), Issue #46 / Issue #40 (research motivation — backward-asymmetry
discriminators, AR-dominance, fossil waves)

---

## Context

Issue #47's grounding pass (2026-07-13, read against installed diffusers
0.39.0 / transformers 5.13.0) found that DiffusionGemma's encoder and decoder
are already separate organs, not one undifferentiated "model":

- **Encoder = the AR hemisphere.** Causal; the sole cache writer
  (`modeling_diffusion_gemma.py:350-351`, the only `past_key_values.update()`
  call path); runs per block on uncached tokens only, sliced by
  `cached_len = past_key_values.get_seq_length()`
  (`pipeline_diffusion_gemma.py:324,326-333`).
- **Decoder = the diffusion hemisphere.** Bidirectional over the canvas;
  computes K/V from canvas tokens only; never updates the cache
  (`modeling_diffusion_gemma.py:422-449`; forward returns no cache, `:1327`).
- **Exactly two inter-hemisphere crossings, both at block granularity:**
  cache-read (encoder → decoder) and committed-canvas re-encode (decoder →
  encoder, `pipeline_diffusion_gemma.py:429` concat then next-block encode).

Issue #46 and Issue #40's research threads (backward-asymmetry discriminators,
the "waves" fossil, KV-mediated garbling) independently converge on the same
seam as the next experimental lever: the cache is DiffusionGemma's sole
cross-block memory channel, so manipulating what crosses it is the only way to
test hypotheses about AR-dominance and fossil permanence without touching the
model.

`past_key_values` is internal to the pipeline's `__call__` today — not a
parameter, not in the output (#47 grounding). The model-level encoder and
`DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion.forward` are directly callable with an
external cache today, so a prefill-from-sequence entry point is buildable
outside the pipeline (#47 grounding, `model.model.encoder(input_ids=…,
past_key_values=cache, position_ids=…)`).

## Decision

**The pack interposes man-in-the-middle on the two block-boundary crossings
between DiffusionGemma's AR hemisphere (encoder) and its diffusion hemisphere
(decoder).** Mechanism: a `KV_CACHE` native socket type plus a
`DGemmaEncode` / `DGemmaDenoise` node pair, with per-layer cache surgery as
the tier-2 experimental surface.

### 1. Governing invariant: a cache crosses any boundary with its provenance record

Generalized from #47's serialization-correction comment: **a cache crosses
any boundary — node-to-node, disk, or process — carrying its provenance
record.** The record is:

- the **minting sequence** (the token ids the encoder consumed to produce
  this cache), when one exists — tier 1, rebuild-via-prefill remains the
  cheap path (ADR-CDG-005 unaffected); or
- **minting sequence(s) + edit-script**, when the cache has been perturbed
  (spliced, ablated, scaled) and no single prefill reproduces it — tier 2.

Disk is a data-plane crossing like any other (`CONSERVE-ACROSS-THE-DATA-BOUNDARY`):
carry the record from the mint, assert the fingerprint at re-entry. This is
the same discipline as ADR-CDG-001's fingerprint/ingress rule, applied to a
live cache object instead of a tensor payload.

### 2. `KV_CACHE` payload schema

Per #47's payload-richness refinement (every structural blocker the grounding
report found converts to schema field or ingress rejection, never a silent
hazard):

- the **live cache object** (`DynamicCache`, per-layer `DynamicLayer` /
  `DynamicSlidingWindowLayer`);
- the **provenance record** (§1);
- **per-layer `cumulative_length`** — the grounding report's ranked #1
  blocker (`cache_utils.py:254`, mask offsets computed from it at `:270`);
  carried as a field `DGemmaEncode` fills, so no consumer hand-tracks it;
- a **geometry fingerprint**: layer-types pattern (5 full-attention / 25
  sliding, at indices `(i+1)%6`), sliding-window size, batch size, dtype,
  per-layer-type RoPE params (full: proportional, θ=1e6, partial_rotary
  0.25; sliding: default, θ=1e4).

**Ingress rule:** the consuming node validates the geometry fingerprint
against the loaded model at ingress and **fails on mismatch** — no silent
mis-masking. This is `EMIT-CANONICAL / PARSE-AT-THE-DOOR` (ADR-CDG-001)
applied to `KV_CACHE`; the socket type is where the honesty lives, not a
limit on what crosses (#47, payload-richness comment).

### 3. Ownership semantics: advance-returns-new-payload is the default

The cache is mutable and the encoder advances it. Fan-out to two consumers
plus one advance is a cross-consumer contamination hazard — the
`STATELESS-CORE` failure shape in miniature (ADR-CDG-008 Correction 1).
**Default: advance-returns-new-payload** — functional, matching
`CANVAS_STATE`'s existing shape (ADR-CDG-005/006) — the encoder/denoise
advance emits a new `KV_CACHE` payload rather than mutating the input in
place.

**Rejected alternatives** (recorded per #47's two-points-the-richness-does-
not-dissolve comment):

- **Copy-on-advance** — every consumer defensively deep-copies before
  advancing. Rejected as the default: pays a real per-block tensor-copy cost
  on every crossing to guard against a fan-out case that is the exception,
  not the norm; the aliasing-contamination failure this guards against is
  better foreclosed by the functional contract than paid for on every call.
- **Documented single-consumer ownership** (convention, no structural
  guard) — rejected as the sole mechanism: a prose-only "don't fan this out"
  rule is exactly the kind of invariant this repo's greenfield discipline
  requires an enforcement surface for, not a comment. Advance-returns-new-
  payload makes the failure mode structurally harder to hit without paying
  copy-on-every-call cost.

### 4. Node pair

- **`DGemmaEncode`** — sequence (`STRING`/token ids) in, `KV_CACHE` out. A
  near-wrapper over the separately-callable encoder (#47 grounding:
  `model.model.encoder(...)` is directly callable today) — thin per
  ADR-CDG-003's node/engine seam.
- **`DGemmaDenoise`** — canvas + `KV_CACHE` in. The block loop moves to
  engine/node ownership (extending ADR-CDG-006's step-window ownership model
  one axis: the cache, alongside the canvas/schedule-position axis
  ADR-CDG-006 already owns). Skips the first encode when a `KV_CACHE` is
  supplied (mirrors ADR-CDG-006's `start_at_step > 0` requires-a-resume-input
  gate). Optional stop-at-block-boundary, emitting the advanced cache as a
  new `KV_CACHE` payload (§3).
- **Save/load pair** (or torch-serializable `KV_CACHE` fields) for tier-2
  artifacts — belongs in the eventual node set alongside the encode/denoise
  pair (#47 serialization-correction comment). Mechanically: `DynamicCache`
  is per-layer K/V tensors + bookkeeping scalars; `torch.save`/load plus the
  provenance envelope is the mechanism; the fingerprint-at-ingress check
  (§2) already covers deserialization hazards (device placement, dtype,
  geometry) since it was designed for caches of unknown history.

### 5. Tier-2 experimental surface: per-layer cache surgery

The two-tier structure (#47):

- **Tier 1 — with-distribution conditioning.** A cache with an intact
  minting sequence; rebuild-via-prefill remains the cheap reproduction path;
  no conflict with ADR-CDG-005.
- **Tier 2 — against-distribution perturbation.** A cache with no single
  minting sequence — splice, ablation, scaling — reproducible only via its
  edit-script (§1). **This requires serialization** (#47
  serialization-correction comment): the tensors are the primary
  experimental artifact once perturbed, and reproducibility demands
  persisting them, not just their recipe.

The 5-full-attention/25-sliding geometry (#47 grounding) makes **full-attention
ablation** (zero/ablate the 5 full-attention layers' cache entries) a direct
utility function on top of tier-2 surgery — a direct test of whether #40's
fossil waves ride the long-range layers, per #47's node-level framing.

## Data channels

*Added 2026-07-13 per operator review of PR #51 ("better definition of how the
actual data 'channels' of input and output work, to review before
implementation"). This section makes the seam's I/O concrete enough that an
implementer cannot misread it. It **does not alter** the Decision above — it
pins the shapes, provenance tags, entry points, ride locations, and per-door
validation the Decision leaves at schema-level. Where a shape cannot be pinned
without a de-risk read against real weights, that is surfaced as an Open
Question, not invented.*

Two node boundaries carry `KV_CACHE`; each has an INPUT face and an OUTPUT
face. The mint identity that makes a cache non-lying (§1, §2) is a single
dataclass — call it the **provenance envelope** — that rides *every* crossing.
Its concrete fields are pinned in §D.0, then each channel says which door it
crosses and what validation fires there.

### D.0 The `KV_CACHE` payload — concrete dataclass

The payload riding the `KV_CACHE` socket is a `dgemma/types.py` dataclass (the
identity, not the ComfyUI socket string — `IDENTITY⊥ENVELOPE`, ARCHITECTURE.md
rule 4), shaped like the existing `CanvasTrace`/`CanvasState` payloads: a live
object plus the mint metadata that keeps it honest. Proposed name `KVCache`
(dataclass) on socket string `DGEMMA_KV_CACHE`.

| field | type | meaning / shape | filled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cache` | `Any` (`transformers.DynamicCache`) | the live per-layer K/V store. Per layer `i`: `key_cache[i]`, `value_cache[i]` each a tensor of shape `(batch, num_kv_heads, seq_len, head_dim)`, dtype `bfloat16`, on the model's device. Layer count == the loaded model's decoder-layer count (30 for `26B-A4B`: 5 full-attention + 25 sliding, at indices `(i+1)%6==0` full). | `DGemmaEncode` |
| `cumulative_length` | `tuple[int, ...]` | per-layer running committed length — the grounding report's ranked-#1 blocker (`cache_utils.py:254`, mask offsets at `:270`). One entry per layer; a consumer NEVER hand-tracks it (§2, Neg-Consequences). | `DGemmaEncode` (advances on each encode) |
| `geometry` | `dict` | the geometry fingerprint (§2): `layer_types` pattern (the 5-full/25-sliding mask), `sliding_window` size, `batch`, `dtype`, per-layer-type RoPE params (full: proportional, θ=1e6, partial_rotary 0.25; sliding: default, θ=1e4). This is what ingress validates against the loaded model. | `DGemmaEncode` (read from `model.config`) |
| `provenance` | `Provenance` (dataclass) | the mint record (§1): `minting_sequence: tuple[int, ...] | None` (token ids the encoder consumed — present for tier 1; `None` once perturbed), `edit_script: tuple[EditOp, ...]` (empty for tier 1; the splice/ablate/scale ops for tier 2), `model_repo_id: str` + `tokenizer_fingerprint: str` (which model/vocab minted it — the identity ingress checks vocab alignment against). | `DGemmaEncode`; `edit_script` appended by any tier-2 surgery op |

`minting_sequence is None and edit_script == ()` is an **illegal state** — an
orphan cache with no provenance at all (the Neg-Consequences "orphan-cache
poisoning" failure). Ingress rejects it (§D.3). This is the ADR-CDG-001 lying-
payload rule in dataclass-invariant form.

### D.1 INPUT channels (what enters, where, provenance, entry point)

**IN-1 — sequence → `DGemmaEncode` (mint a fresh cache).** Enters as token ids
(`STRING`/token-id list). Provenance: this node is the *mint*; it stamps
`provenance.minting_sequence = <these ids>`, `edit_script = ()`,
`model_repo_id`/`tokenizer_fingerprint` from `dgemma_model`. No `KV_CACHE`
ingress validation (nothing crossed yet); the mint is where the envelope is
*created*, not checked. Foreign-AR-model authorship (concept.md: "any AR model
can author the run-on text") is handled here by feeding foreign-authored ids —
but DiffusionGemma's *own* encoder weights encode them, so the cache geometry
is always DG's, never the foreign model's. **Failure this prevents:** a cache
minted with no record of which ids produced it — unreproducible tier-1
conditioning.

**IN-2 — `KV_CACHE` → `DGemmaDenoise` (inject a known-provenance cache).** This
is issue #47's motivating capability. The cache enters as a `KV_CACHE` payload
(the dataclass above). Entry point into the one contract: a **new declarative
parameter on `run_diffusion`**, `kv_cache: KVCache | None = None` — additive-
optional, defaulting `None` (today's exact behavior: `DGemmaDenoise` with no
injected cache mints its own via the first encode, mirroring ADR-CDG-006's
`start_at_step > 0` requires-a-resume-input gate). This honors rule 7: the
cache is a **declarative payload validated at ingress, never an executable
participant** — `run_diffusion` receives *data* (a cache object + its envelope),
not a closure or a hook. `None` leaves rule-6 `STATELESS-CORE` trivially
satisfied (no injected state crosses; the run mints fresh). **Failure this
prevents:** the injection door being opened as a second executable seam (a
surface handing in code), which rule 7 forecloses — it is a data door only.

**IN-3 — `KV_CACHE` → `DGemmaEncode` (advance an existing cache, cross-block
re-encode).** The decoder→encoder committed-canvas re-encode crossing
(`pipeline_diffusion_gemma.py:429`) surfaced as a node input: a prior block's
`KV_CACHE` plus the newly-committed canvas ids enter `DGemmaEncode`, which
encodes the committed block into the cache and emits a **new** payload (§3
advance-returns-new-payload; OUT-2). Provenance: `minting_sequence` extends by
the committed ids (tier 1 stays tier 1); `cumulative_length` advances per
layer. **Failure this prevents:** a re-encode that mutates the input cache in
place, contaminating a fan-out branch (§3, the `STATELESS-CORE`-in-miniature
aliasing hazard).

**IN-4 — serialized `KV_CACHE` → load node (deserialize a tier-2 artifact).**
A `torch.save`d cache + its envelope re-enters from disk (§4 save/load pair).
Disk is a data-plane crossing like any node-to-node one (§1,
`CONSERVE-ACROSS-THE-DATA-BOUNDARY`): the same §D.3 ingress fires on the
deserialized payload. Provenance for tier-2 artifacts is `minting_sequence =
None` + a non-empty `edit_script` (the only reproduction path once perturbed).
**Failure this prevents:** a deserialized cache built against a different
model's geometry (device/dtype/layer-type drift) attaching silently — caught
by the geometry-fingerprint check, which was designed for caches of unknown
history (§4).

### D.2 OUTPUT channels (what comes back, where it rides, retention policy)

**OUT-1 — `DGemmaDenoise` → `KV_CACHE` (the advanced cache).** When
`DGemmaDenoise` stops at a block boundary (§4 optional stop), it emits the
advanced cache as a **new** `KV_CACHE` payload (§3), with `cumulative_length`
and `provenance.minting_sequence` advanced by the committed block. Rides its
own socket, not a trace field. **Retention policy — named, because KV caches
are large:** the advanced-cache output is emitted **only when the stop-at-block
boundary is requested**; a run to completion does not retain intermediate
per-block caches (they are advanced-through, not accumulated). A `KVCache`
payload is one live `DynamicCache` at a time — O(context) memory, not
O(context × blocks). The tier-2 serialization artifact (§5) is opt-in via the
save node; nothing auto-persists caches.

**OUT-2 — `DGemmaEncode` → `KV_CACHE` (the minted/advanced cache).** IN-1's
mint and IN-3's advance both exit here as a fresh payload. Same
advance-returns-new-payload discipline; same one-cache-at-a-time retention.

**OUT-3 — injection provenance → `CanvasTrace` (the record that a cache was
injected).** When a run is driven with an injected cache (IN-2), the fact and
identity of the injection must be recoverable from the trace, or a downstream
analysis cannot tell a conditioned run from an unconditioned one — the
`CanvasTrace` "mint identity gives the readings their meaning" discipline
(`types.py:99-124`) applied to the cache axis. Rides as an **additive-optional
field on `CanvasTrace`** under the #35 R6 additive-optional discipline
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` R6 row): `injected_cache_provenance: Provenance | None =
None` (default `None` — unchanged for every non-injected run today). It carries
the envelope's *identity* (minting sequence hash / edit-script summary /
`model_repo_id`), **not** the tensors — the tensors are large and already have
their own OUT-1/save-node home; duplicating them into the trace would violate
OUT-1's retention policy. **Failure this prevents:** a fossil-wave ablation
study whose trace cannot say the cache it ran against was injected/perturbed —
a conclusion that looks grounded but isn't (Neg-Consequences orphan-cache
poisoning, trace side).

**Per-step deltas are OUT OF SCOPE for this channel set.** Capturing how the
injected cache changes the *per-step* canvas distribution is a `DISTRIBUTION`-
tap concern (the seam-inventory `DISTRIBUTION` primitive, gated on #11/#14),
not a `KV_CACHE` output. This ADR's OUTPUT channels carry caches and injection
provenance; they do not carry per-step distribution deltas. Recorded so an
implementer does not fold a distribution capture into the cache payload.

### D.3 VALIDATION at each door (ingress checks + enforcement surface)

Every `KV_CACHE` ingress (IN-2, IN-3, IN-4) runs one validator —
`validate_kv_cache_ingress(payload, dgemma_model)` — before the payload is
used. Fail-on-mismatch, never trust-and-degrade (rule 5,
`EMIT-CANONICAL / PARSE-AT-THE-DOOR`). Each check names the failure it prevents
(greenfield anticipated-failure anchoring):

| # | ingress check | failure it prevents | enforcement surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | layer count of `cache` == loaded model's decoder-layer count | a cache from a differently-sized model attaching with a truncated/over-long layer set — silent wrong-geometry attention | `test_kv_ingress_layer_count_mismatch_raises` (unit, synthetic cache vs. model config) |
| V2 | `geometry.layer_types` / `sliding_window` / RoPE params == `model.config` derivation | the Neg-Consequences "silent geometry mismatch" — a cache built against one layer-type pattern fed to another produces wrong masks with no crash | `test_kv_ingress_geometry_fingerprint_mismatch_raises` |
| V3 | `cumulative_length` present, one entry per layer, non-negative | the ranked-#1 blocker: a stale/uninitialized `cumulative_length` silently corrupting mask offsets (`cache_utils.py:254,270`) — plausible-but-wrong mask | `test_kv_ingress_missing_or_ragged_cumulative_length_raises` |
| V4 | `provenance.tokenizer_fingerprint` / `model_repo_id` match the loaded model | vocab misalignment — a cache minted under a different tokenizer conditioning the canvas on token ids that mean something else (the orphan-provenance poisoning, vocab flavor) | `test_kv_ingress_vocab_mismatch_raises` |
| V5 | provenance non-orphan: NOT (`minting_sequence is None` and `edit_script == ()`) | a cache with no reproduction path at all — unreproducible, unauditable experimental input (§D.0 illegal state) | `test_kv_ingress_orphan_provenance_raises` |
| V6 | `cache` dtype / device match the loaded model | a CPU-loaded or fp32 deserialized cache (IN-4) attaching to a bf16-on-GPU model — device/dtype drift that would error deep in attention rather than at the door | `test_kv_ingress_dtype_device_mismatch_raises` |

Enforcement-surface home: these rows extend `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s enforcement-
surface table with a `KV_CACHE` ingress row (`NOT-YET-IMPLEMENTED` until the
node pair lands), alongside the existing declarative-payload ingress row (rule
7). The validator is engine-side (`dgemma/`, ComfyUI-agnostic per ADR-CDG-003);
the socket string is surface-side.

```

Read: `DGemmaEncode` is the sole minter/advancer (mirrors the model's
sole-cache-writer encoder, `modeling_diffusion_gemma.py:350-351`);
`DGemmaDenoise` is the sole consumer (mirrors the read-only decoder). Every
arrow crossing the seam into a consumer passes `[V1..V6]` ingress. The
re-encode crossing (bottom) is the model's own decoder→encoder loop
(`:429`) surfaced as the IN-3 node input. OUT-3 records injection identity on
the trace without duplicating the tensors.

## Rationale

### Positive Consequences

- **A cache-manipulation bench becomes buildable without touching model
  code.** The encoder and decoder's already-separate-organ structure (#47
  grounding) means MITM-ing the seam is additive instrumentation, not a
  model fork.
- **Direct empirical purchase on #40/#46's open questions.** Cache/window
  manipulation is a second discriminator (alongside ADR-CDG-010's pin
  mechanism) for retrieval-limited vs. prior-limited backward-asymmetry
  hypotheses (#46), and full-attention ablation is a direct test of whether
  fossil waves ride the long-range layers (#40, #47).
- **No conflict with ADR-CDG-005.** `CANVAS_STATE`'s KV exclusion was
  economy (routine save-states shouldn't bloat with recomputable tensors),
  not impossibility. `KV_CACHE` is a distinct, deliberate experimental
  payload type for a distinct purpose; tier-1 rebuild-via-prefill remains
  `CANVAS_STATE`'s cheap path unchanged.
- **The fingerprint/ingress rule forecloses silent mis-masking by
  construction**, not by discipline — the same structural move ADR-CDG-001
  and ADR-CDG-010/011 already use for other payloads.

### Negative Consequences

- **Orphan-cache poisoning downstream conclusions.** A `KV_CACHE` payload
  crossing without its provenance record is a lying payload in the
  ADR-CDG-001 sense: a downstream analysis (e.g. a fossil-wave ablation
  study) run against a cache of unknown minting history produces a
  conclusion that looks grounded but isn't. This is the failure §1's
  invariant exists to prevent.
- **Wrong `cumulative_length` silently corrupts masks.** The grounding
  report's ranked #1 blocker (`cache_utils.py:254,270`) — an
  uninitialized or stale per-layer `cumulative_length` does not raise; it
  produces a plausible-looking but wrong attention mask. This is why §2
  makes it a schema field `DGemmaEncode` fills, never a value a consumer
  hand-tracks.
- **Aliasing contamination across graph branches.** Without §3's default,
  a `KV_CACHE` fanned to two consumers plus one advance lets one branch's
  mutation bleed into another's — a `STATELESS-CORE` violation in miniature
  (ADR-CDG-008 Correction 1's failure shape, here on a cache instead of a
  scheduler).
- **Silent geometry mismatch.** A `KV_CACHE` built (or perturbed) against
  one model's layer-type pattern, fed to a differently-configured model,
  produces wrong attention geometry with no crash — the reason §2 makes
  fingerprint validation mandatory at ingress rather than advisory.
- **Perturbed-cache irreproducibility without an edit record.** A tier-2
  cache with no minting sequence and no edit-script is an experimental
  artifact nobody can reproduce or audit — the reason §1 generalizes the
  provenance requirement to cover edit-scripts, not just minting sequences.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Copy-on-advance as the default ownership semantics

**Why rejected:** Guards against the fan-out/aliasing hazard by paying a
tensor-copy cost on every advance, regardless of whether the run ever forks.
Advance-returns-new-payload (the `CANVAS_STATE` precedent) achieves the same
safety without a copy on the common, non-forking path.

### Option B: Documented single-consumer ownership, no structural guard

**Why rejected:** A convention enforced only by a docstring is exactly the
"invariant enforced only by prose" pattern this repo's discipline treats as
one refactor from gone. Advance-returns-new-payload makes the hazard
structurally harder to hit instead of merely discouraged.

### Option C: Treat `KV_CACHE` as reopening ADR-CDG-005's KV exclusion

**Why rejected:** Conflates two different questions. ADR-CDG-005 excluded
KV from the *routine save-state* on economy grounds (recomputable, not worth
the bloat). `KV_CACHE` is a *deliberate experimental payload* for a
different purpose (cache surgery, cross-block memory manipulation) that
ADR-CDG-005 never addressed. Treating this ADR as amending ADR-CDG-005 would
misrepresent both decisions' scope; they compose without conflict, per #47's
serialization-correction comment.

### Option D: Skip serialization; treat tier 2 as in-graph-only

**Why rejected — corrected mid-thread (#47).** Initially framed as "the
`KV_CACHE` socket is in-graph only; persistence reopens ADR-CDG-005
territory." Operator push-back: serialization is not a barrier, and tier 2
*requires* it — a perturbed cache has no minting sequence, so no prefill
reproduces it; the tensors themselves are the experimental artifact.
Mechanically trivial (`torch.save`/load + the provenance envelope), and the
fingerprint-at-ingress check (§2) already covers the deserialization
hazards. Rejecting persistence would make tier-2 experiments irreproducible
by design.

## Open Questions

- [ ] **Untested assumption: the decoder driven with a caller-built cache
      the pipeline didn't create.** Position/mask math should hold per the
      cited source (#47 grounding), but this is unverified against real
      weights. **Resolution trigger:** the designated de-risk experiment — a
      first real-weights smoke test — MUST run before `DGemmaDenoise`
      implementation proceeds past its skeleton.
- [ ] **Scope boundary, stated explicitly: in-block bidirectional attention
      severing is OUT OF SCOPE for this ADR.** Cache surgery (§5) cuts
      *context routes* only — which prior tokens' K/V a block's decoder can
      attend to. Intervening on the decoder's own bidirectional mask
      *within* a block (severing attention between canvas positions in the
      same denoise step) is a different mechanism entirely and would need
      its own ADR. This ADR does not decide, and does not imply, anything
      about in-block mask intervention.
- [ ] **Block loop ownership: graph-side vs. node-internal.** `DGemmaDenoise`
      §4 states the block loop "moves to engine/node ownership" but does not
      decide whether iteration is node-internal (mirroring ADR-CDG-006's
      step-windowed-pipeline-subclass shape) or graph-side (a For/While loop
      pack this checkout doesn't ship). This is ADR-CDG-006's territory
      verbatim — inherited here, not re-litigated. **Resolution trigger:**
      same as ADR-CDG-006's own open state; no in-tree For/While primitive
      exists today, so node-internal iteration is the only buildable shape
      until that changes.

- [ ] **`CANVAS_STATE` resume under an injected tier-2 cache — a genuine
      tension with ADR-CDG-005 the channel definition surfaced.** ADR-CDG-005
      excludes KV from the resume save-state on the ground that it is
      *recomputable from the committed prefix via one prefill pass* (ADR-CDG-005
      §"KV cache is deliberately excluded", Option B). That ground holds for a
      **tier-1** cache (its minting sequence prefills it back). It does **not**
      hold for a **tier-2** perturbed cache: no prefill reproduces it (§5,
      Option D — that is precisely why tier 2 requires serialization). So a
      `CANVAS_STATE` captured mid-run *while a tier-2 cache is injected* is not
      self-sufficient — resuming it re-prefills a cache that never matches the
      perturbed one that produced the frames. This does **not** reopen
      ADR-CDG-005's routine exclusion (tier-1 resume is unaffected, per Option
      C); it names a case ADR-CDG-005's recomputability premise did not cover.
      **Resolution trigger:** decide, before `CANVAS_STATE`+`KV_CACHE`
      co-capture is built, whether a tier-2-injected resume must reference the
      serialized cache artifact (by envelope identity, like OUT-3) rather than
      relying on prefill — a per-run flag on `CANVAS_STATE`, not a change to its
      default shape. This is a channel-composition question, not a Decision this
      ADR makes.

**Resolution plan:** the real-weights smoke test gates all implementation
past a skeleton; the scope boundary and block-loop-ownership questions are
recorded as open and must not be silently decided by implementation ahead of
their resolution triggers. The `CANVAS_STATE`-under-tier-2 tension is recorded
as open (not decided here) and gates any `CANVAS_STATE`+`KV_CACHE` co-capture
work.
