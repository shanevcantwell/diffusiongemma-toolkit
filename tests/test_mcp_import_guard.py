"""`surfaces/mcp/`'s optional-dependency guard (deliverable 5: "a structural
import guard, not a hard requirement" — the ComfyUI surface must keep
loading with zero MCP deps present, mirroring how this pack already treats
ComfyUI itself as absent-by-design in core tests).

Two things this asserts, run out-of-process (subprocess) so a real absent-
`mcp` environment is observed rather than simulated by hiding an
already-imported module from `sys.modules` (which would not catch a
transitive import that runs before the hide takes effect):

1. `surfaces.mcp` (the package init) and `surfaces.mcp.state_manager` import
   with ZERO `mcp` SDK present — neither imports anything from the `mcp`
   package, so their absence-of-crash is a free assertion in THIS
   environment (the real one for CI: `mcp` is an optional extra, not a
   `[project] dependencies` entry, so a bare ComfyUI-only install genuinely
   lacks it).
2. `surfaces.mcp.commands.model` / `.generate` / `.encode` / `.server` (the
   modules that DO need the real SDK to function) raise an actionable `RuntimeError`
   naming the missing 'mcp' optional extra when it's absent — never a bare
   `ModuleNotFoundError` with no context, and never a silent no-op that
   would let a caller think the surface "worked" without the SDK.

This repo's own venv (used by the rest of the suite) has `mcp` installed
(needed for `tests/test_mcp_surface_seam.py` etc. to exercise the real
dispatch path) — so these tests spawn a subprocess with a THROWAWAY
`sys.path`-shadowing shim: a same-named `mcp` directory is never created;
instead the subprocess script inserts a `sitecustomize`-free blocker via
`sys.meta_path` that raises `ModuleNotFoundError` for `mcp`/`mcp.*` before
the real package (if any) is found. This proves the guard's behavior
without needing a second, mcp-less virtualenv.
