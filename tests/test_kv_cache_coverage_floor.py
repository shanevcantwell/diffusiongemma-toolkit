"""tests/test_kv_cache_coverage_floor.py — ADR-CDG-012 DV.1 (issue #62 §H):
per-module 100% row-coverage floor on the `KV_CACHE` channel-crossing code,
mechanism (b) per the ratified implementation plan.

The ADR's DV.1 clause requires 100% row coverage on the channel-crossing
modules, measured in the greater-system (full mocked suite) profile — but
`coverage.py`'s `fail_under` is a single global threshold that cannot
natively express "these named files at 100%, the rest unchanged" (the ADR's
own DV.1 Open Question). Issue #62's ratified plan resolves the mechanism
question in favor of (b): a DEDICATED gate test (this file) that reads the
already-produced `.coverage` dataset and asserts each named channel module
is at 100%, failing CI **by module name** — never a `fail_under`-scoped
second coverage run (see the plan's §H for the full 5-point rationale: this
composes with the repo's existing single in-process run, doesn't risk
silently widening/narrowing an `omit` list, and reads whichever dataset is
present, including #59's combined unit+e2e dataset).

**Scope is explicit, not inflated (DV.1's own guard):** ONLY the modules this
phase's `KV_CACHE` channel code actually lives in. This test makes zero
claim about `dgemma/model.py`'s pre-existing, unrelated coverage gap (the
`from_pretrained` boundary only the `live` suite can reach) — it is not in
the allowlist below, so a regression there cannot be silently smuggled past
this gate, and this gate cannot regress model.py's gap into a false
blocker either.

**This test SKIPS (never fails) when no `.coverage` data is present** — e.g.
a bare `pytest` invocation with no `--cov`/`coverage run` wrapper. It is
meant to be run ALONGSIDE a coverage-collecting invocation (`pytest --cov`
or, per issue #50's own-run workaround, `python -m coverage run -m
pytest`), not as a replacement for one. A hard failure on absent data would
make every coverage-less test run of the suite fail this file for a reason
that has nothing to do with the invariant it guards.
